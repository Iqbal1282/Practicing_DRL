# 📘 Grokking Reinforcement Learning — Algorithm Practice

This repository contains my personal experiments with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms inspired by the book **"Grokking Reinforcement Learning" by Miguel Morales**. The goal of this project is to deeply understand RL concepts by coding them from scratch and analyzing their behaviors through experiments.

## 📚 About the Book

[Grokking Reinforcement Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-reinforcement-learning) offers a hands-on, intuitive, and visual approach to learning foundational RL concepts. It covers essential topics such as:

- Multi-armed bandits
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Monte Carlo (MC) Methods
- Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning
- Policy Gradient
- Actor-Critic methods
- and more.

This repository mirrors the structure of the book, implementing each core algorithm and experimenting with variations.
